# üõµ Bike Price Analysis & Prediction Project Summary

## üîç Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) Insights

### 1. Price Distribution by Brand

* **Premium brands (Harley, KTM, Honda)** command higher prices.
* **Economy brands (Hero, Bajaj, TVS)** have tighter price ranges.
* ‚úÖ **Model Insight:** Include `brand` as a categorical feature; consider price tier encoding.

### 2. Price vs Power

* Clear **positive correlation**: more power (bhp) means higher price.
* ‚úÖ **Model Insight:** `power_clean` is a strong numeric predictor.

### 3. Price vs Bike Age

* **Negative trend**: bikes depreciate rapidly in the first 5‚Äì8 years.
* ‚úÖ **Model Insight:** `bike_age` is a key feature; consider interacting with mileage.

### 4. Price by Location

* Cities like **Mumbai, Pune, Bengaluru** show higher average prices.
* ‚úÖ **Model Insight:** Use `location` as a regional feature (target/group encoding).

## üß† Machine Learning Modeling Insights

### Models Used:

1. **Linear Regression**
2. **Random Forest Regressor**
3. **XGBoost Regressor**

### Performance Overview (example):

| Model             | R¬≤ Score | MAE (INR) | RMSE (INR) |
| ----------------- | -------- | --------- | ---------- |
| Linear Regression | 0.58     | 18,000    | 25,000     |
| Random Forest     | 0.87     | 8,000     | 12,000     |
| XGBoost           | 0.89     | 7,500     | 11,000     |

### Modeling Takeaways

* **XGBoost** delivered best results due to non-linear handling.
* **Random Forest** also performed well.
* **Linear Regression** struggled with outliers and non-linearities.
* ‚úÖ **Top features:** `power_clean`, `bike_age`, `brand`, `location`, `kms_driven_clean`

---

## üßπ Data Cleaning & Preprocessing

* Removed units from `power`, `mileage`, `kms_driven` columns.
* Handled nulls using median imputation.
* Detected and removed outliers using the **IQR method**.
* Normalized numeric features using **Min-Max scaling** and **Standardization**.
* ‚úÖ Result: Improved stability and accuracy of models.

## üìà Final Recommendations

| Task                | Recommendation                                                          |
| ------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Feature Engineering | Use `bike_age`, `brand`, `power_clean`, `location`, `kms_driven_clean`  |
| Best Model          | **XGBoost** for performance, **Linear Regression** for interpretability |
| Scaling             | Required for linear models; optional for tree-based models              |
| Outliers            | Always detect and remove with IQR before modeling                       |
| Explainability      | Use SHAP or feature importance to visualize impact                      |

## üëç Optional Next Steps

* Add **SHAP values** to explain model predictions visually.
* Deploy model via **Streamlit or Flask** for user interaction.
* Track model performance on new unseen listings.
